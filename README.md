# Uber planning to explore and contribute to OpenStreetMap

# Overview 

Hello OSM mappers,

We at Uber are planning to explore and contribute to OpenStreetMap in various places across the globe.

We do not plan to make any large-scale, customer reported edits for this project.. All edits will be made by a team of individuals based in India and USA. The team will be using the available data sources in the JOSM tool for their corrections and validations. We have shared the profiles of our editors on [Data Team page](https://github.com/UBER-OSM-Project/Team-Members/wiki/OSM-TEAM-MEMBERS). 

The edits will be made according to the Organized editing best practices and country-specific OSM policies. In addition to that, Uber editors are also committed to improve their edits based on feedback from the community and by leveraging local knowledge to help identify data issues and resolution. For this project, our team intends to focus on adding and modifying the following OSM features:

   1. Geometry includes (updation of geometries including alignments, missing road features, Nodes connectivity etc.)
   2. Road Network (Road Class, Road Condition, Turn restriction, Directionality etc.)
   3. Display map features (Building Footprints, Land use etc.)
   4. Mapping indoor airport features such as terminals, entrances, security checks, elevators, and escalators for improved indoor navigation
   5. Creating and updating walking paths and sidewalks to enhance walkability


Please feel free to reach out to us with feedback, questions, and suggestions at OSM@uber.com.

We would appreciate your suggestions and cooperations going forward!
